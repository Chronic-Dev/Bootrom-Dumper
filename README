What to know about the Bootrom Dumper Utility (BDU) :
- you need a mac or linux box to use it / build it
- libusb > 1.0.8 required
- compatible with A4 devices (iPhone 4, iPod 4G, iPad, AppleTV 2) and older devices (iPhone 3Gs, iPod 3G)
- build it by running make with these arguments:
    DEVICE=< a4 | 3g | 3gs_new_bootrom >
    ARCH=mac if you're not using linux
- execute it with root privileges (sudo ./bdu)

Happy Reverse Code Engineering !
